## Needed to install

Min. 13-17 GB internal storage depending whether you have an SD card and your choose in the code (see below).

ARM Prozessor 64-bit (probably max. 6 year old low budget device)

Android 7+ (more reports necessary)

## Easy install

Download the following files: <br> <br>
[Termux.apk](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/download/v0.118.0/termux-app_v0.118.0%2Bgithub-debug_arm64-v8a.apk) <br>
[Termux:Widget.apk](https://github.com/termux/termux-widget/releases/download/v0.13.0/termux-widget_v0.13.0%2Bgithub-debug.apk)
<br>
[VNC Viewer v3.8.0.48261.apk](https://github.com/Android-PowerUser/Windroid_11/releases/download/untagged-3d8afee65340ab832c3e/VNC.Viewer_3.8.0.48261-arm64.apk) <br> <br>
and install (go in the Android settings and enable install of unknown sources)

Open Termux and copy/paste the follow code:
```
termux-setup-storage
pkg update -y
pkg upgrade -y
pkg i proot p7zip pulseaudio wget -y
# swap the "#" in the next line with the next one after that to download on the SD-Card (it will still be installed on the internal memory)
# cd ./storage/external-1/
cd /sdcard/Download/
wget https://github.com/Android-PowerUser/Windroid_11/releases/download/2023.07.29/Win11.7z.001 https://github.com/Android-PowerUser/Windroid_11/releases/download/2023.07.29/Win11.7z.002 https://github.com/Android-PowerUser/Windroid_11/releases/download/2023.07.29/Win11.7z.003 # link muss beim ver√∂ffentlichen aktualisiert werden.
7z x ./Win11.7z.001 -o/data/data/com.termux/files/home/ # .002,.003 is automatically recognized in the same directory.
cd /data/data/com.termux/files/home/
chmod +x ./Win11
./Win11

```
Then press [Enter] (in your keyboard) and if you see:
```
It appears that directory '~/storage' already exists.
This script is going to rebuild its structure from
scratch, wiping all dangling files. The actual storage
content IS NOT going to be deleted.

Do you want to continue? (y/n)
```
tap n and press Enter.
Otherwise accept the storage permission. 

During the process you will be asked several times:
```
The default action is to keep your current version.
*** motd (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ?
```
Press N and Enter every times.

Now, if you know you don't have Android 12+ or disabled Phantom_Process_Killer you can go to the VNC Viewer app during the installation. Otherwise, wait in Termux(!) until Termux has completed the process. In the VNC Viewer, click the + and enter :1 in the first line.  Leave the second blank and tap "ok". In "picture quality" select "high" otherwise Windroid 11 will only appear in 256 colors. Go back to termux, if not already complete. The Win11.7z is divided into 3 parts. Therefore, do not be irritated if several larger files are downloaded.<br>
<br>
After the completed installation go back to VNC Viewer and press "Connect".  Disable "warn me every time" then press "Ok", enter the password 123456 and confirm.
Complete.
You are viewing Windroid 11!

You can now delete the files downloaded from Termux in the Downloads folder of the internal memory or if you have changed it on the SD card in the path "/Android/data/com.termux/files/".

For the next start, long press on an empty space in your Android home screen and select Widget and find a small icon from the app Termux:Widget and place it on the home screen.  When you press it, Windroid 11 will start

## If you get an error while installing
If you no longer have access to your storage due to duplicate termux-setup-storage, try deleting the permissions on the Termux storage and then(!):
```
rm -rf ./storage/
termux-setup-storage
```

If
```
wineserver crashed, please enable coredumps (ulimit -c unlimited) and restart.
```
happened when you open Steam, try:
```
apt install box64-android=0.2.3+20230603.4f1cefe-1
```
in termux Windroid 11 .

## Documentation
##### A complete documentation is coming soon.
You can manage Windroid 11 file system with the AOSP-Files app or [MiXplorer](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/mobile/folders/1BfeK39boriHy-9q76eXLLqbCwfV17-Gv?usp=share_link&pli=1) for example and also Windroid 11 can access internal memory and SD card in path "/Android/data/com.termux/files/". For example, like Samsung, if you can't see the AOSP-Files app, you can install this [AOSP-Files shortcut app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marc.files).

With MiXplorer, you must first add a storage, then select Termux in the AOSP-Files app in the hamburger menu.  You don't need the shortcut app for that, no matter what brand you have.  Whenever possible, you should manage Windroid 11's file system via Android because it's faster.  Keep in mind that some files are only virtual and some contents of files as well.

Logically, no browser is installed in Windroid 11 because you already have one on your Android.  You can easily access the internal memory from Windroid 11.


It is based on the Linux kernel that is preinstalled on every Androidsystem.
